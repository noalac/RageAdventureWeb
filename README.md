Processing.js based game engine demo. IQ challenge game.

Game ideas come from ThankCreate. And this repo mainly focuses on web implementations of games.

More Info:
  Processing is an extension of Java, so the Processing codes can be easily packed into a Java applet or application. However, in this repo, I am using the processing.js to convert processing into JavaScript. Which can run in a "canvas" component with the support of HTML5.
