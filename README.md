RageAdventureWeb
================

Processing.js based game engine demo. IQ challenge game.

Game ideas come from ThankCreate. So the shorter repo name "RageAdventure" will be left for ThankCreate himself.
And this repo mainly focuses on web implementations of games.

More Info:
  Processing is an extension of Java, so the processing codes can be easily packed into a Java Applet or Application. However, in this repo, I am using the processing.js to convert processing into JavaScript. Which can run in a "canvas" component with the support of HTML5. That's to say, you can play with your brower.

The game can be instantly played at http://rage.sinaapp.com
